# xpeho_ui_swift_test

Dedicated repository for [xpeho_ui_swift](https://github.com/XPEHO/xpeho_ui_swift) package

## Getting Started

In Xcode just open this project and make sure you have the last version of [xpeho_ui_swift](https://github.com/XPEHO/xpeho_ui_swift) package added.

You can manage UI tests linked to this package in _XpehoUI/XpehoUIUITests_.

It uses the [swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) to generates screenshots of components in scene the first time you test and comparate them to new screenshots the next time.

Snapshots are available in \_XpehoUI/XpehoUIUITests/\_\_Snapshots\_\_\_
